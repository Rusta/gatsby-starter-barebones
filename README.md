# gatsby-starter-barebones
Stripped back, barebones gatsby-starter which implements two example pages: one in markdown, one in JS

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:

```
gatsby new my-project-name https://github.com/Rusta/gatsby-starter-barebones
```

# Why not use Preact?
There is a clone of this repository at https://github.com/Rusta/gatsby-starter-barebones-preact that has been modified to use Preact in the build output rather than React to reduce the bundle file size:

## File Size on Disk (before GZipping)
- Bundle size with React: 251KB
- Bundle size with Preact: 131KB

Feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/Rusta/gatsby-starter-barebones-preact)
